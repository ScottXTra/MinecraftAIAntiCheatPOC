# MinecraftAIAntiCheatPOC
Proof of concept for a nueral network based cheat detection system for movment based cheats in videogames. 
# Basic premises: 
  1. Collect large amounts of movement data of players that are not cheating in your game of choice
  2. Collect movement data of players that are cheating in your game of choice
  3. Train the network to know what cheating movement "looks" like
  4. Decide the threshold for detection/ number of detections required to notify staff or auto-ban the player
